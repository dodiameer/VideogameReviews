## Opinion:

A **great** racing simulator with a great selection of cars and tracks to suit any taste. *However,* playing without a wheel can cause *some* issues if you aren't too experienced. The game **needs** some experience in sim-racing but a beginner can get the hang of it, although you need to be patient and handle some rage.

Pros:

- Realistic simulation.
- Large selection of cars and tracks.
- High customizability for setups.
- Dynamic weather.

Cons: 

- Wheel not required but will be needed.
- **NOT** for beginners to the genre.
- Car default setup mostly sucks and needs a lot of tuning.
- Career mode feels lacking.
