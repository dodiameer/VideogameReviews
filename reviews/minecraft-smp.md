# Description:

Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios. Created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language and released as a public alpha for personal computers in 2009, the game was officially released in November 2011, with Jens Bergensten taking over development around then. Minecraft has since been ported to various platforms and become the best-selling video game of all time, with 200 million copies sold across all platforms and 126 million monthly active users as of 2020.

In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally-generated 3D world with infinite terrain, and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures or earthworks. Depending on game mode, players can fight computer-controlled "mobs", as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode, in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources. Players can modify the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets. 

## Opinion:

Minecraft SMP (Survival Multiplayer) is decent on online, public servers when playing with strangers, because your experience depends on the people with you. Where SMP shines, however, is when playing with friends (or a single friend), because you know them and they know you, so you'll share resources (or steal them), prank eachother, *and* help eachother when someone digs into a cave and their pickaxe breaks and they can't craft another one and they also don't have torches and a spider is attacking them so you have to find them and save their ass ***cough***. All these things wouldn't happen easily with strangers because you don't have that friendship bond just yet, and if you're like me (An introvert), you won't be able to make friends with them easily. Having a friend join with you on the first day and having the struggle of finding sheep so you can craft a bed before night-time *together*, is much more fun than struggling alone before finding others and becoming friends once you've had all the basic help you'd have needed.
