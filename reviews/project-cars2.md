## Opinion

A **great** racing simulator with a great selection of cars (180+) and tracks to suit any taste, however playing without a wheel can cause some issues if you aren't too experienced. The game needs some experience in sim-racing but even a beginner will get the hang of it (Although you need to be patient and handle some rage).
